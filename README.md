In this project, I built a **Google Search Suggestions** app by applying the concepts I have learned till now.

<summary>Functionality</summary>
<br/>

The app will have the following functionalities

- Initially, all suggestions in the `suggestionsList` will be displayed
- When a value is provided in the search input, then display the suggestions which includes the search input irrespective of case
- When the arrow of a suggestion is clicked, then the value of the search input will be updated with the respective suggestion clicked
- The `GoogleSuggestions` component receives the `suggestionsList` as a prop. It consists of a list of suggestion objects with the following properties in each suggestion object

  |    Key     | Data Type |
  | :--------: | :-------: |
  |     id     |  Number   |
  | suggestion |  String   |

</details>
